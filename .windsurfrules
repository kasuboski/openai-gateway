## Project Technology
This is a cloudflare worker project. Always read the cloudflare [docs](docs/cloudflare.md) when working on anything cloudflare related.

Cloudflare bindings are autogenerated. Add bindings in `wrangler.jsonc` and run `npm run cf-typegen` to generate types at `worker-configuration.d.ts`. These types are available globally. You don't need to import them.

The project uses Typescript. Prefer strongly typed code.

## Development environment
* All terminal commands should be run prefixed with `direnv exec .`
  Ex. `direnv exec . npx wrangler dev` `direnv exec . npm run cf-typegen`
